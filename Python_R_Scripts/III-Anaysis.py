    ANALYSIS AND HYPOTHESIS WITH A GENOME SCALE METABOLIC MODEL
From the given functions, the information you got about the cobra language,
and the result of previous TD part, try to answer the following questions.
files: practical_metabolic_model.pdf

For a better understanding, you can also open the file function.py to see how some functions are built.
During this tutorial you will use object oriented language.
"""
######A
# 1- Load module:
from functions import *

#2- Dowload and import e_coli_core model:

#3 - Print information about the model:

#4- Launch the flux balance analysis without changing any parameter:

#5- Print the objective value. Was it what you expected? 

#6- Print fluxes. How many reactions are active in this condition?

#7 From the fluxes, define which metabolites are consume and produce by the model?
#Verify your result with the summary function:


#8- print the summary of one of these metabolites  to see how it's produced and consumed:

#9- Verify if the model can grow without oxygen:
## Create a new model to keep initial state

## Set upper bound and lower bound:

## Launch fba

## Conclude

#10- Verify if the model can use other carbon sources : lactate or formate.
## Create a copy of the model

## Close the model

## Change bound to allow entry of the target metabolite and verify the change is done:

#11- It is possible to produce  acetate and to grow? change the objective function (growth min 0.20):

## Change the coefficient for ac from 1 to 0.5 for example. What do you observe?

#Let's look all of this in an entire model;
"""  In biggest model is more difficult to interpret something. Lets see if we can answer to some
question using different functions.
