    STUDY OF THE STRUCTURE OF A GENOME SCALE METABOLIC MODEL
From the given function and the information you got about the cobra language,
try to answer the following question.
files: practical_metaboli_model.pdf
model : study_model.xml
model2 : ####you can chose####
For a better understanding, you can also open the file functions.py to see how some function are built.
During this tutorial you will use object oriented language.

#13- Donload a model from bigg models database
print("Number of metabolites" , len(BiGG_model.metabolites))
#14- Import the model:

#15- How many reactions?

#16- how many metabolites?

#17- Wich compartments?

#18- Stoichiometric Matrix (show limited at 500/500):

#19- How many exchange reactions ?

#20- How many sink reactions?

#21- How many demand reactions?

#22- What is the objective function ? Maximise or minimize ?
